DNADIST Project

FILES
	dnadist.c - The source code for the main program, DNADIST.
	seq.c, seq.h - The source code and header file for the sequence library (part of the Phylip library).
	phylip.c, phylip.h - The source code and header file for general Phylip functionalities.
	Makefile - The makefile to compile the program.
	group7_report.pdf - The written report to accompany the program.
	maui.job - The maui submission script to run the program.
	README   - The file you are currently viewing. :)

HOW TO COMPILE
	On PrairieFire, type the following command:
		make dnadist

HOW TO RUN
	Before the program can be ran, the input file needs to be in the same directory as the program. The name
	of the input file needs to be 'infile'.  On PrairieFire, the program needs to be submitted to the Maui 
	scheduler. This can be accomplished by typing the following command:
		qsub maui.job

CHECKING THE STATUS OF RUNNING JOB
	Jobs being ran can be checked using the qstat -u [username]. This will show all running jobs for the username
	given. (exclude the brackets).

OUTPUT
	The output will be put into a file called 'outfile' in the same directory as the program.

HOW TO CHANGE THE NUMBER OF PROCESSES:
	The number of processes that run the program is specified in the maui.job file. In the maui.job file,
	there is a line that is similar to the one below:
		#PBS -l select=X:IB 
	'X' is the number of processes that will be running the program. For example, if the program is run on 
	8 processors, then the line in the maui.job file should look like the following:
		#PBS -l select=8:IB 

ERRORS
	Any errors that may potentially occur will be put within the mpi.stderr file. If something does not run as
	expected, look within this file to find the cause.
